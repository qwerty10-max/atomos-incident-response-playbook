## Core Kali Tools & How to Use Them in IR

### 1. `tshark` â€“ Network Traffic Capture & Analysis

* CLI version of Wireshark
* Capture suspicious traffic for packet-level inspection
* Example:

  ```bash
  sudo tshark -i eth0 -w /tmp/attack.pcap
  ```
* Use alongside playbook steps for network evidence collection

### 2. `autopsy` â€“ Forensic File & Disk Analysis

* GUI for Sleuth Kit to analyze disk images and extract artifacts
* Run:

  ```bash
  autopsy
  ```
* Use to analyze disk images from `collect_forensics.ps1` or Linux dumps

### 3. `theHarvester` â€“ OSINT Collection

* Gathers emails, subdomains, hosts, employee names from public sources
* Example:

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b google
  ```
* Helps during reconnaissance or phishing investigations

## Integrating Kali with Your Playbook

* Use Kali VM or live boot to run collection & analysis tools quickly
* Scripts from `/scripts/linux` can be run directly on Kali
* Export Kali tool outputs (pcaps, logs, reports) into your IR documentation and SIEM
* Build automated detection signatures using Kali tools + Sigma rules from the playbook

## Pro Tips

* Set up Kali in your lab environment via Vagrant or VirtualBox
* Combine Kaliâ€™s nmap scanning with your network checklists for threat hunting
* Use Kaliâ€™s Python environment to run or extend playbook automation scripts
