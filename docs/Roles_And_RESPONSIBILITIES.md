# üë• Roles & Responsibilities (Roles_And_RESPONSIBILITIES.md)

## üß≠ Objective
Clearly define the roles, responsibilities, and escalation flow of all stakeholders involved in the incident response lifecycle. This ensures fast action, accountability, and minimal chaos during a live incident.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Incident On-Call Rotation

* All team members must be reachable 24/7 during assigned IR duty periods.
* On-call schedule managed via \[pager tool / Slack / Opsgenie].
* Backup responders should be trained and ready to act in primary‚Äôs absence.

| ---------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Analyst    | SIEM, EDR                  | Alert-level logs | No                    |
| Forensics  | Disk imaging, memory tools | Full logs        | No                    |
| IR Manager | All platforms              | All logs         | Yes                   |
| Legal      | Reports, email data        | Limited          | No                    |

## üì¶ Backup / Surge Support

During severe or prolonged incidents, consider:

* Activating **external IR firms** (e.g., Mandiant, CrowdStrike)
* Calling **legal breach counsel**
* Scaling up via **contracted MSSPs**
* Engaging **crisis comms consultants**

## üß† Final Thought

Your IR team is only as strong as your clarity of **roles and communication**. During a real breach, seconds count ‚Äî and confusion costs more than downtime.
